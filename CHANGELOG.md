## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Added `perfgate doctor` to diagnose local setup, config loading, benchmark
  command availability, baseline presence, artifact directory writability, CI
  detection, and baseline-server health.
- Added schema-first structured performance evidence contracts for
  `perfgate.probe.v1`, `perfgate.probe_compare.v1`,
  `perfgate.scenario.v1`, and `perfgate.tradeoff.v1`.
- Added `perfgate ingest probes --file probes.jsonl` to convert
  language-agnostic probe JSONL into `perfgate.probe.v1` receipts.
- Added `perfgate probe compare` and `perfgate.probe_compare.v1` receipts for
  named probe deltas between baseline and current structured evidence.
- Added `perfgate scenario evaluate` to turn configured weighted scenarios and
  benchmark compare receipts into `perfgate.scenario.v1` workload receipts.
- Added optional scenario `probe_compare` references so workload receipts can
  carry advisory probe names and probe-compare receipt references.
- Added `perfgate tradeoff evaluate` to turn configured tradeoff rules and
  scenario receipts into `perfgate.tradeoff.v1` decision receipts.
- Added Markdown and PR-comment rendering for `perfgate.tradeoff.v1` decision
  receipts via `perfgate md --tradeoff` and `perfgate comment --tradeoff`.
- Extended `xtask schema-compat` with baseline-service record, health-response,
  and fleet fixtures so the 0.16 server API contract is checked alongside
  receipt compatibility.

### Changed
- Bumped Rust minimum supported version (MSRV) to 1.93.
- Collapsed the 0.16 public crate surface to the five intended publishable
  packages: `perfgate`, `perfgate-cli`, `perfgate-types`,
  `perfgate-client`, and `perfgate-server`.
- Moved former domain and application implementation crates under the public
  facade as `perfgate::domain` and `perfgate::app`, leaving the old
  `perfgate-domain` and `perfgate-app` packages as workspace-only
  compatibility wrappers.
- Extended `xtask arch` and `xtask public-surface --strict` so CI enforces the
  collapsed module/package boundaries for the 0.16 release line.

### Fixed
- Fixed clippy warnings by replacing `sort_by` with `sort_by_key` and `std::cmp::Reverse` for descending sorts in storage backends.

## [0.15.1] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed
- Restored local `perfgate serve` baseline workflows by injecting a synthetic auth context for local-mode API routes.
- Tightened baseline-service docs so `README`, getting-started guides, and service notes match the current shipped surface instead of historical or aspirational behavior.

### Changed
- Bumped the workspace and internal crate versions to `0.15.1`.
- Updated GitHub Action examples to pin `EffortlessMetrics/perfgate@v0.15.1`.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added

- **Regression Blame** — Automated identification of dependency updates in `Cargo.lock` that contribute to performance regressions.
- **Automated Performance Bisection** — New `perfgate bisect` command that uses `git bisect` and `paired` benchmarking to pinpoint the exact commit introducing a regression.
- **Distributed Gating (0.14.0)** — Introduced `perfgate aggregate` for merging multiple run receipts (e.g., from a fleet of runners) into a single weighted verdict.
- **Deep Observability (0.11.0)** — Expanded metric collection to include `io_read_bytes`, `io_write_bytes`, `network_packets`, and `energy_uj`.
- **Windows IO Metrics** — Implemented native IO counter collection on Windows via `GetProcessIoCounters`.
- **Noise & Flakiness Detection (0.10.0)** — Introduced `NoisePolicy` (`ignore`, `warn`, `skip`) for CV-based escalation and automated skipping of unstable benchmarks.

- **History CLI** — New `perfgate baseline verdicts` command for viewing historical performance trends and status transitions.
- **Confidence Intervals** — Welch's t-test now includes confidence interval (CI) calculation for paired differences.
- **Web Dashboard (Alpha)** — `perfgate-server` now serves a minimal read-only dashboard at `/` for browsing projects, benchmarks, and viewing historical trends with interactive charts.
- **Enhanced Summaries** — `U64Summary` and `F64Summary` now include optional `mean` and `stddev` fields, enabling more detailed variance analysis and noise detection.
- **OIDC Integration** — `perfgate-server` now supports GitHub Actions OIDC tokens for authentication, mapping repository claims directly to project IDs and roles via `--github-oidc` flags.

### Changed
- **perfgate-stats computation** — Statistical summarization now uses Welford's online one-pass algorithm for improved numerical stability when computing mean and variance.

- **Unix rusage math** — Improved `timeval` delta calculation to correctly handle microsecond rollovers.
- **Smoke Lane Contracts** — Aligned cockpit mode artifacts with dogfooding verification requirements.
- **Baseline Handling** — Ensured non-positive baselines are handled gracefully by skipping instead of panicking.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Self-Dogfooding Infrastructure** — `perfgate` now uses itself to gate its own performance across three CI lanes (Smoke, Perf, and Nightly).
- **Multi-Lane CI Workflows** — Implemented `perfgate-self.yml` and `perfgate-nightly.yml` with unique artifact naming and authoritative runner pinning (`ubuntu-24.04`).
- **Hardened Workload Wrappers** — Introduced `.ci/perf/lib.sh` for shared binary resolution and strict exit code classification (allowing 0, 2, 3 while failing on crashes).
- **Automated Baseline Lifecycle** — Nightly calibration now generates candidate baselines and automatically proposes refreshes via bot-driven Pull Requests.
- **Learning Loop & Trends** — Added trend export to JSONL and Prometheus formats in the nightly lane for long-term drift analysis.
- **Paired Observation Lane** — New "PR-vs-Main" lane dogfoods interleaved benchmarking by comparing the current binary directly against the last blessed `main` binary.
- **Enhanced Repo Automation** — Added `xtask dogfood` subcommands for fixture regeneration and artifact verification, plus a framework for `docs-sync`.
- **New Micro-crate** — Introduced `perfgate` facade crate as the high-level entrypoint for the ecosystem.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-12

### Changed
