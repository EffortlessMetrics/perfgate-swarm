# Codex Goals

Codex goal manifests record current agent execution state. They are
machine-readable pointers to the proposal, spec, plan, policy, proof commands,
allowed files, forbidden files, and completion criteria for the active lane.

Use `.codex/goals/active.toml` for the current goal and `.codex/goals/archive/`
for completed or superseded manifests.

Do not use `.perfgate/` for Codex goal state. `.perfgate/` is reserved for
product-generated user artifacts from `perfgate init` and related workflows.

## Boundaries

- Goal TOML may reference a proposal, spec, ADR, plan, policy file, or status
  doc.
- Goal TOML may constrain file scope and proof commands for Codex.
- Goal TOML must not define new product behavior.
- Goal TOML must not duplicate policy ledgers or release-readiness matrices.
