# Release Readiness: v0.15.1

Last verified: 2026-03-28 after publishing `v0.15.1`, publishing crates.io packages, and merging the release workflow and publish-preflight fixes.

Current-main note: this file is the historical readiness record for `v0.15.1`.
Since that release, `main` has added API key management CLI support, audit
logging, and executable documentation example validation. For the current
baseline-service surface, see [Baseline Service Notes](BASELINE_SERVICE_DESIGN.md)
and [Getting Started with the Baseline Server](GETTING_STARTED_BASELINE_SERVER.md).

## Patch Scope

This patch release is intentionally narrow:
- restore local `perfgate serve` baseline workflows (`promote --to-server`,
  `baseline list`, `baseline history`, `compare --baseline @server:<bench>`)
- align baseline-service docs with the actual `0.15.x` command and server
  surface
- roll examples and release docs forward to `v0.15.1`

## Current Status

- Workspace and internal crate versions are set to `0.15.1` on `main`.
- The local-mode baseline fix and doc cleanup are merged on `main`.
- `cargo run -p xtask -- ci` passed locally on 2026-03-28 against `main`.
- `cargo run -p xtask -- publish-check` passed locally on 2026-03-28 against `main`.
- GitHub release `v0.15.1` is published with platform binaries and `sha256sums.txt`.
- Publishable workspace crates are now published to crates.io at `0.15.1`.
- GitHub Action tags now include the exact release tag `v0.15.1` plus moving aliases `v0.15` and `v0`.

## Tested and Working

These commands were tested end-to-end on Windows (x86_64, Rust 1.92):

| Command | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `run` | **Works** | Clean receipts, Windows IO metrics collected |
| `compare` | **Works** | Correct deltas, exit codes |
| `md` | **Works** | Clean Markdown table output |
| `github-annotations` | **Works** | Emits correct annotation format |
| `report` | **Works** | Generates perfgate.report.v1 |
| `promote` | **Works** | Copies and normalizes receipts |
| `export --format csv` | **Works** | Correct CSV with headers |
| `export --format jsonl` | **Works** | Valid JSON per line |
| `export --format junit` | **Works** | Valid XML |
| `export --format html` | **Works** | Valid HTML table |
| `export --format prometheus` | **Works** | Valid text exposition format |
| `check` | **Works** | Config-driven, finds baselines via `baseline_pattern` |
| `paired` | **Works** | Interleaved execution, produces compare receipt |
| `summary` | **Works** | Terminal table from compare receipts |
| `aggregate` | **Works** | Emits `perfgate.aggregate.v1` with policy verdicts |
| `explain` | **Works** | Generates diagnostic text |
| `blame` | **Works** | Diff two Cargo.lock files |
| `bisect` | **Not tested** | Wraps git bisect, requires repo with history |
| `serve` | **Works** | Local SQLite dashboard/server; local baseline workflows re-verified |
| `baseline upload` | **Works** | Requires `pg_live_` key with 32+ char suffix |
| `baseline list` | **Works** | Lists uploaded baselines correctly |
| `baseline download` | **Works** | Note: uses `--output` not `--out` |
| `baseline history` | **Works** | Local-mode smoke flow re-verified in 0.15.1 prep |
| `baseline delete/verdicts` | **Not tested** | Server is functional, but these were not re-run for this patch |
| `check --mode cockpit` | **Works** | Produces sensor.report.v1 envelope + extras |

## Known Bugs

- [#55](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perfgate/issues/55) ~~Leftover DEBUG prints~~ — **Fixed** (committed)
- [#56](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perfgate/issues/56) ~~CLI examples in docs use wrong flags~~ — **Fixed** (committed)
- [#58](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perfgate/issues/58) Server `--api-keys` glob `*` pattern causes 500 errors (use `.*` as workaround)

## Doc/Flag Mismatches Found During Testing (all fixed)

### `paired` command
- Docs said `--threshold 0.20` — **fixed** to `--fail-on-regression 20.0`
- Docs omitted required `--name` flag — **fixed**

### `blame` command
- Docs say `--compare cmp.json` — **wrong**. Actual: `--baseline <Cargo.lock> --current <Cargo.lock>`

### `bisect` command
- Docs say `--bench my-bench --config perfgate.toml` — **wrong**. Actual: `--good <COMMIT> --executable <PATH>`

### `baseline download` command
- Docs say `--out` — **wrong**, actual flag is `--output`

### `check` with `baseline_dir`
- `baseline_dir` may have path resolution issues in mixed Unix/Windows environments (MSYS2). `baseline_pattern` with absolute path works reliably.

### `run -p perfgate` vs `run -p perfgate-cli`
- `cargo run -p perfgate` fails (no bin target — it's a library facade). **Fixed**: all docs now use `cargo run -p perfgate-cli --`.

## What's Solid (ship with confidence)

The **core local gating pipeline** is production-quality:
- `run` → `compare` → `md`/`report` → `promote`
- `check` (config-driven single command)
- `paired` (noise-resistant benchmarking)
- All export formats
- Exit code contract (0/1/2/3)
- JSON receipt versioning
- Host fingerprinting
- Statistical significance (Welch's t-test)

## What's Functional But Needs Hardening

- **Baseline server** — works for dev/small-team. Storage backends (SQLite, PostgreSQL, S3) are implemented. Not load-tested. GitHub Actions OIDC is exercised; GitLab and custom OIDC exist but remain lightly exercised.
- **`bisect`** — wraps git bisect. Works in concept but depends on repo structure and build system. Edge cases likely.
- **`explain`** — generates prompts, doesn't call an LLM. Useful but the name oversells it.
- **`aggregate`** — formal fleet/matrix receipt with all/majority/weighted/quorum/fail-if-n-of-m gating. Weight keys use `os-arch` labels such as `linux-x86_64`.

## What's Still Missing / Deferred

- **Windows timeout support** — returns `AdapterError::TimeoutUnsupported`
- **Windows page_faults/ctx_switches** — not collected
- **OIDC beyond GitHub Actions** — GitLab/Okta not tested
- **`cargo run -p perfgate` ergonomics** — doesn't work without specifying `--bin`

## Added After v0.15.1 on Main

- **API key management CLI** — `admin keys create|list|revoke|rotate`
  manages server API keys through the CLI.
- **Audit logging** — baseline, verdict, and key mutations write audit events;
  `GET /api/v1/audit` exposes the audit log.
- **Executable doc tests** — `cargo run -p xtask -- doc-test` validates
  documentation CLI examples plus TOML, JSON, and YAML snippets, and runs from
  `xtask ci`.

## Post-Release Follow-Up

1. **Keep action runtimes current** — first-party actions are on current majors, but future runner/runtime upgrades still need periodic review
2. **Carry the release workflow repair forward** — future tags should continue using the recovered workflow now merged on `main`
3. **Keep crates publish preflight in CI** — `cargo run -p xtask -- publish-check` now guards missing crate readmes and `publish = false` workspace dependencies before release
