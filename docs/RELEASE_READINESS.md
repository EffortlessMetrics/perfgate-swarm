# Release Readiness

Last verified: 2026-05-08 after merging the 0.16 public-surface collapse,
first-run onboarding hardening, server operations visibility, and health
contract compatibility through PR #291.

## Current Main Snapshot

Verified on 2026-05-08 after merging release-readiness work through PR #291.

The current `main` branch is not a published release, but the 0.16 public crate
surface and paved first-run workflow are now in their intended release shape:

| Gate | Status | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| Public package allowlist | Passing | `cargo run -p xtask -- public-surface --strict` |
| Architecture boundary enforcement | Passing | `cargo run -p xtask -- arch` |
| Publish metadata preflight | Passing | `cargo run -p xtask -- publish-check` |
| Package file-list proof | Release-prep gate | `cargo run -p xtask -- publish-check --package-list` |
| Publish dry-run proof | Per-package release gate | `cargo run -p xtask -- publish-check --dry-run --package perfgate-types` |
| GitHub Action install wiring | Passing | `cargo run -p xtask -- action-check` |
| Schema compatibility | Passing | `cargo run -p xtask -- schema-compat`, including `/health` response fixtures |
| Documentation examples | Passing | `cargo run -p xtask -- docs-check` and `cargo run -p xtask -- doc-test` |
| First-run paved road | Covered | `crates/perfgate-cli/tests/cli_first_run_e2e_tests.rs` |
| Baseline bootstrap UX | Covered | `crates/perfgate-cli/tests/cli_baseline_bootstrap_tests.rs` |
| Server operations visibility | Covered | `perfgate serve --doctor`, `/health`, `/metrics`, `audit list`, and dashboard audit view tests |
| Full repo CI | Passing | Hosted `ci`, `fuzz`, and `perfgate-self` on PR #291 |

The only publishable packages allowed by policy are:

```text
perfgate
perfgate-cli
perfgate-types
perfgate-client
perfgate-server
```

Before cutting a 0.16 release, run the package proof without `--allow-dirty`:

```bash
cargo run -p xtask -- public-surface --strict
cargo run -p xtask -- arch
cargo run -p xtask -- publish-check --package-list
cargo run -p xtask -- publish-check --dry-run --package perfgate-types
cargo run -p xtask -- action-check
cargo run -p xtask -- docs-check
cargo run -p xtask -- doc-test
cargo run -p xtask -- schema-compat
cargo run -p xtask -- ci
```

Run `publish-check --dry-run --package <name>` immediately before publishing each
crate in dependency order. Cargo verifies packaged dependencies against
crates.io, so downstream crates such as `perfgate` and `perfgate-cli` cannot be
dry-run verified until their same-release workspace dependencies have already
been published.

For PR validation before the branch is committed or while release notes are still
being edited, `publish-check` also accepts `--allow-dirty`. Release operators
should omit it.

The GitHub release workflow builds the platform archives, unpacks each generated
archive, verifies the binary exists, and runs `perfgate --version` plus
`perfgate doctor --help` on native targets before uploading release assets.

The GitHub Action path is also guarded: `xtask action-check` verifies action
inputs and install wiring, and the action prints a local reproduction command
plus discovered artifact paths when `perfgate check` exits nonzero.

Former implementation packages such as `perfgate-domain` and `perfgate-app`
are workspace-only compatibility wrappers. Domain logic lives under
`perfgate::domain`; app orchestration and runtime adapters live under
`perfgate::app` and `perfgate::runtime`.

For the current baseline-service surface, see
[Baseline Service Notes](BASELINE_SERVICE_DESIGN.md) and
[Getting Started with the Baseline Server](GETTING_STARTED_BASELINE_SERVER.md).

For the current first-run path, see the `Start Here` section in
[the README](../README.md). The documented happy path is:

```bash
cargo binstall perfgate-cli
perfgate doctor
perfgate init --ci github --profile standard
perfgate check --config perfgate.toml --all
perfgate baseline promote --config perfgate.toml --all
```

## Historical Record: v0.15.1

## Patch Scope

This patch release is intentionally narrow:
- restore local `perfgate serve` baseline workflows (`promote --to-server`,
  `baseline list`, `baseline history`, `compare --baseline @server:<bench>`)
- align baseline-service docs with the actual `0.15.x` command and server
  surface
- roll examples and release docs forward to `v0.15.1`

## Current Status

- Workspace and internal crate versions are set to `0.15.1` on `main`.
- The local-mode baseline fix and doc cleanup are merged on `main`.
- `cargo run -p xtask -- ci` passed locally on 2026-03-28 against `main`.
- `cargo run -p xtask -- publish-check` passed locally on 2026-03-28 against `main`.
- GitHub release `v0.15.1` is published with platform binaries and `sha256sums.txt`.
- Publishable workspace crates are now published to crates.io at `0.15.1`.
- GitHub Action tags now include the exact release tag `v0.15.1` plus moving aliases `v0.15` and `v0`.

## Tested and Working

These commands were tested end-to-end on Windows (x86_64, Rust 1.92):

## Known Bugs

- [#55](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perfgate/issues/55) ~~Leftover DEBUG prints~~ — **Fixed** (committed)
- [#56](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perfgate/issues/56) ~~CLI examples in docs use wrong flags~~ — **Fixed** (committed)
- [#58](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/perfgate/issues/58) Server `--api-keys` glob `*` pattern causes 500 errors (use `.*` as workaround)

## Doc/Flag Mismatches Found During Testing (all fixed)

### `paired` command
- Docs said `--threshold 0.20` — **fixed** to `--fail-on-regression 20.0`
- Docs omitted required `--name` flag — **fixed**

### `blame` command
- Docs say `--compare cmp.json` — **wrong**. Actual: `--baseline <Cargo.lock> --current <Cargo.lock>`

### `bisect` command
- Docs say `--bench my-bench --config perfgate.toml` — **wrong**. Actual: `--good <COMMIT> --executable <PATH>`

### `baseline download` command
- Docs say `--out` — **wrong**, actual flag is `--output`

### `check` with `baseline_dir`
- `baseline_dir` may have path resolution issues in mixed Unix/Windows environments (MSYS2). `baseline_pattern` with absolute path works reliably.

### `run -p perfgate` vs `run -p perfgate-cli`
- `cargo run -p perfgate` fails (no bin target — it's a library facade). **Fixed**: all docs now use `cargo run -p perfgate-cli --`.

## What's Solid (ship with confidence)

The **core local gating pipeline** is production-quality:
- `run` → `compare` → `md`/`report` → `promote`
- `check` (config-driven single command)
- `paired` (noise-resistant benchmarking)
- All export formats
- Exit code contract (0/1/2/3)
- JSON receipt versioning
- Host fingerprinting
- Statistical significance (Welch's t-test)

## What's Functional But Needs Hardening

- **Baseline server** — works for dev/small-team. Storage backends (SQLite, PostgreSQL, S3) are implemented. Not load-tested. GitHub Actions OIDC is exercised; GitLab and custom OIDC exist but remain lightly exercised.
- **`bisect`** — wraps git bisect. Works in concept but depends on repo structure and build system. Edge cases likely.
- **`explain`** — generates prompts, doesn't call an LLM. Useful but the name oversells it.
- **`aggregate`** — formal fleet/matrix receipt with all/majority/weighted/quorum/fail-if-n-of-m gating. Weight keys use `os-arch` labels such as `linux-x86_64`.

## What's Still Missing / Deferred

- **Windows timeout support** — returns `AdapterError::TimeoutUnsupported`
- **Windows page_faults/ctx_switches** — not collected
- **OIDC beyond GitHub Actions** — GitLab/Okta not tested
- **`cargo run -p perfgate` ergonomics** — doesn't work without specifying `--bin`

## Added After v0.15.1 on Main

- **Paved first-run setup** — `perfgate init --ci github --profile standard`
  writes `perfgate.toml`, `.github/workflows/perfgate.yml`,
  `baselines/.gitkeep`, and `.perfgate/README.md`; `--preset` remains a
  compatibility alias.
- **Baseline bootstrap UX** — `perfgate baseline status` and
  `perfgate baseline promote --all` cover the local-baseline path without
  requiring users to hand-map receipt files.
- **First-run e2e fixture** — the beginner flow now has an integration test
  that runs init, doctor, check, and baseline promotion against a generated
  project.
- **Action failure reproduction** — the composite action preserves artifacts
  and prints the local `perfgate check` command needed to reproduce a failed
  gate.
- **API key management CLI** — `admin keys create|list|revoke|rotate`
  manages server API keys through the CLI.
- **Audit logging** — baseline, verdict, and key mutations write audit events;
  `GET /api/v1/audit`, `perfgate audit list`, `perfgate audit export`, and the
  dashboard expose the audit log.
- **Server doctor and health detail** — `perfgate serve --doctor` preflights
  the local SQLite path, WAL setup, and dashboard port; `/health` reports
  sanitized storage detail and pool occupancy.
- **Operational metrics** — `/metrics` exposes request, auth, upload, verdict,
  baseline, and storage-error metrics with `perfgate_` names.
- **Executable doc tests** — `cargo run -p xtask -- doc-test` validates
  documentation CLI examples plus TOML, JSON, and YAML snippets, and runs from
  `xtask ci`.
- **Schema compatibility coverage** — `cargo run -p xtask -- schema-compat`
  checks historical receipt fixtures plus 0.16 baseline-service, audit,
  health, and fleet API fixtures.

## Post-Release Follow-Up

1. **Keep action runtimes current** — first-party actions are on current majors, but future runner/runtime upgrades still need periodic review
2. **Carry the release workflow repair forward** — future tags should continue using the recovered workflow now merged on `main`
3. **Keep crates publish preflight in CI** — `cargo run -p xtask -- publish-check` now guards missing crate readmes and `publish = false` workspace dependencies before release
