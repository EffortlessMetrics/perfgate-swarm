# ADR 0003: Presentation Layer Split (Render, Export, CLI)

## Status
Superseded by `docs/adr/PERFGATE-ADR-0001-public-crates-are-contracts.md`

## Context
The user-facing output logic (Markdown tables, JSON/CSV exports, and CLI
interaction) was previously mingled in `perfgate::app` and `perfgate-cli`. This
made it difficult to add new output formats without touching the core
orchestration logic.

## Decision
We separated the presentation layer into distinct seams:

- `perfgate::presentation::render`: Pure rendering logic for Markdown (using
  Handlebars) and terminal output.
- `perfgate::presentation::export`: Logic for transforming run/compare data
  into external formats (CSV, JSONL, HTML, Prometheus).
- `perfgate-cli`: Entry point responsible for argument parsing (clap) and
  wiring up the application.

## Consequences
- Rendering can be unit-tested by comparing string outputs without running the
  full application.
- Adding a new export format (e.g., OpenTelemetry) only requires changes to
  `perfgate::presentation::export`.
- `perfgate-cli` remains a thin wrapper around `perfgate::app`, focusing on the
  user interface and exit codes.
