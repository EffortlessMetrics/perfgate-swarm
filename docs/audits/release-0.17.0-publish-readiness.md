# v0.17.0 Publish Readiness Proof

Date: 2026-05-12

Branch: `release/validate-0.17.0-readiness`

Purpose: validate that the v0.17.0 release candidate is ready for the separate
tag and publish step. This proof does not publish crates, create tags, or create
GitHub releases.

Publication follow-up: the later public release state is recorded in
[`release-0.17.0-publication-closeout.md`](release-0.17.0-publication-closeout.md).
This readiness proof remains the pre-publish record.

## Environment

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Rust toolchain | `cargo +1.95.0` |
| Target directory | `C:\perfgate-target-msrv` |

| `cargo +1.95.0 run -p xtask -- publish-check --dry-run --package perfgate-cli` | Pass | Packaged, verified, and aborted upload because of dry run. |

## Known Gaps

- Crates were not published.
- No `v0.17.0` tag was created.
- No GitHub release was created.
- Post-publish install proof, including `cargo-binstall perfgate-cli --version
  0.17.0 --force`, remains blocked until the crates and release assets exist.

## Release Boundary

The next irreversible step is tag and publish. Run it only after the release
proof PR is merged to `main` and the required hosted checks are green.
