# Output Schemas

perfgate uses versioned JSON receipts at every stage of the pipeline.

## Receipt And Service Types

| Schema | Produced by | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `perfgate.run.v1` | `run`, `check` | Raw measurement data from a benchmark execution |
| `perfgate.compare.v1` | `compare`, `check`, `paired` | Comparison of current run against baseline |
| `perfgate.probe.v1` | `ingest probes` | Named probe observations from internal phases or external instrumentation |
| `perfgate.scenario.v1` | `scenario evaluate` | Weighted workload-scenario evidence across benchmarks, phases, or probe groups |
| `perfgate.tradeoff.v1` | schema-first contract | Structured decision evidence for accepted or rejected performance tradeoffs |
| `perfgate.report.v1` | `report`, `check` | Cockpit-compatible report envelope with findings, summary, and optional `profile_path` diagnostic |
| `sensor.report.v1` | `check --mode cockpit` | Sensor integration envelope for dashboards |
| `perfgate.baseline.v1` | baseline service | Stored baseline record returned by the server |
| `perfgate.verdict.v1` | baseline service | Stored verdict history, including optional noise history fields |
| `perfgate.audit.v1` | baseline service | Append-only audit event for baseline, verdict, and key mutations; inferred by fixture filename because current audit events do not include a `schema` field |
| `perfgate.health.v1` | baseline service | Health response for liveness and storage readiness; inferred by fixture filename because `/health` responses do not include a `schema` field |
| `perfgate.dependency_event.v1` | fleet API | Dependency-change event with performance impact |
| `perfgate.fleet_alert.v1` | fleet API | Fleet-wide dependency regression alert |

## Additional Generated Schemas

perfgate also commits generated schemas for tooling and editor integration:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `schemas/perfgate.config.v1.schema.json` | Validates `perfgate.toml` / JSON config shape, including optional per-benchmark scaling configuration |
| `schemas/perfgate.probe.v1.schema.json` | Validates probe receipts for named phase/span metrics from external instrumentation |
| `schemas/perfgate.scenario.v1.schema.json` | Validates weighted scenario receipts used to explain workload-level outcomes |
| `schemas/perfgate.tradeoff.v1.schema.json` | Validates tradeoff receipts that explain why local regressions were accepted or rejected |
| `schemas/perfgate.report.v1.schema.json` | Validates report receipts, including additive diagnostics such as `profile_path` |

## JSON Schema Generation

Auto-generated schemas (via `schemars`):

```bash
# Generate to schemas/
cargo run -p xtask -- schema

# Verify committed schemas match generated output
cargo run -p xtask -- schema-check

# Verify old release fixtures still deserialize with current types
cargo run -p xtask -- schema-compat
```

## Probe JSONL Ingestion

`perfgate ingest probes` converts language-agnostic probe JSONL into a
`perfgate.probe.v1` receipt:

```bash
perfgate ingest probes --file probes.jsonl --out probe.json
```

Each non-empty JSONL line is one probe observation. Lines may use the full
`ProbeObservation` shape, or a compact flat shape where numeric top-level fields
become metrics:

```json
{"probe":"parser.tokenize","scope":"local","wall_ms":12.4,"alloc_bytes":184320,"items":10000}
```

## Scenario Evaluation

`perfgate scenario evaluate` reads configured `[[scenario]]` entries and their
benchmark compare receipts, then writes a `perfgate.scenario.v1` weighted
workload receipt:

```bash
perfgate scenario evaluate --config perfgate.toml --out artifacts/perfgate/scenario.json
```

By default, each scenario reads `[defaults].out_dir/<bench>/compare.json`.
Set `compare = "path/to/compare.json"` on a scenario to override that lookup.

## Fixture Validation

Validate JSON files against the vendored `sensor.report.v1` schema:

```bash
# Validate all known fixtures
cargo run -p xtask -- conform

# Validate a specific file
cargo run -p xtask -- conform --file path/to/report.json

# Validate all JSON files in a directory
cargo run -p xtask -- conform --fixtures path/to/dir
```

The vendored schema lives at `contracts/schemas/sensor.report.v1.schema.json`.
This schema is hand-written (not auto-generated) to maintain a stable contract
with external consumers.

Historical compatibility fixtures live under `fixtures/schema/<release>/`.
`schema-compat` checks v0.15 examples for `perfgate.run.v1`,
`perfgate.compare.v1`, `perfgate.report.v1`, `sensor.report.v1`,
and `perfgate.health.v1`.
It also checks v0.16 baseline-service and fleet contract fixtures for
`perfgate.baseline.v1`, `perfgate.verdict.v1`, `perfgate.audit.v1`,
`perfgate.health.v1`, `perfgate.dependency_event.v1`, and
`perfgate.fleet_alert.v1`, plus structured-evidence fixtures for
`perfgate.probe.v1`, `perfgate.scenario.v1`, and `perfgate.tradeoff.v1`.

## Versioning Policy

Every receipt includes a `schema` field (e.g., `"perfgate.run.v1"`) that
identifies its type and major version. The full evolution policy is defined in
[ADR 0012](adrs/0012-schema-evolution-policy.md). Key guarantees:

- **Additive only within a major version.** New optional fields may be added to
  v1 at any time. Existing fields are never removed, renamed, or retyped.
- **Breaking changes require a new major version.** A v2 schema introduces a
  separate Rust struct and a new `schema` field value (e.g., `perfgate.run.v2`).
- **Coexistence window.** When v(N) ships, v(N-1) remains fully supported for
  at least 2 minor releases. The server serves both versions simultaneously via
  `/api/v1` and `/api/v2` route prefixes.
- **Migration tooling.** `perfgate migrate` converts stored artifacts between
  major versions offline. The server also exposes a migration endpoint for
  on-the-fly conversion.
- **Deprecation signals.** Deprecated versions emit CLI warnings and HTTP
  `Deprecation` headers before removal.
