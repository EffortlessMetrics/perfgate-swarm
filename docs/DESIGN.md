# perfgate Design

This document describes the measurement model, regression mathematics, and algorithmic design of perfgate.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

## Measurement Model

### Samples and Statistics

perfgate collects raw samples and computes summary statistics:

**Sample Fields:**
- `wall_ms`: Wall-clock execution time in milliseconds
- `exit_code`: Process exit code
- `warmup`: Boolean flag indicating warmup sample
- `timed_out`: Boolean flag indicating timeout occurred
- `max_rss_kb`: Maximum resident set size in KB (Unix + best-effort Windows, optional)
- `cpu_ms`: Combined user and system CPU time in milliseconds (Unix + best-effort Windows, optional)
- `stdout`: Truncated stdout (optional, up to `output_cap_bytes`)
- `stderr`: Truncated stderr (optional, up to `output_cap_bytes`)

**Statistics (U64Summary):**
- `median`: Median value (middle element for odd count, floor of average of two middle elements for even count)
- `min`: Minimum value
- `max`: Maximum value

**Statistics (F64Summary):**
- `median`: Median value (average of two middle elements for even count)
- `min`: Minimum value
- `max`: Maximum value

### Warmup Semantics

Warmup samples are executed before measured samples to prime caches, JIT compilers, and other runtime systems.

**Invariants:**
1. Total iterations = `warmup + repeat`
2. First `warmup` iterations MUST have `sample.warmup = true`
3. Remaining `repeat` iterations MUST have `sample.warmup = false`
4. Statistics MUST be computed from non-warmup samples only
5. Adding or modifying warmup samples MUST NOT change computed statistics

### Repeat Count

The `repeat` parameter controls the number of measured samples:

- MUST be at least 1
- Default is 5 (provides reasonable median stability)
- Higher values increase measurement confidence but extend execution time

### Throughput Calculation

When `work_units` is specified, throughput is computed as:

```
throughput_per_s = work_units / (wall_ms / 1000.0)
```

**Edge Cases:**
- If `wall_ms = 0`, throughput is `0.0` (not infinity)
- Throughput is computed per-sample, then summarized

## Regression Mathematics

### Baseline vs Current Comparison

For each metric with a configured budget, perfgate computes:

```rust
let ratio = current / baseline;        // e.g., 1.10 for 10% increase
let pct = (current - baseline) / baseline;  // e.g., 0.10 for 10% increase
```

### Direction Semantics

Each metric has a **direction** that determines what constitutes improvement
or regression. perfgate MUST NOT infer movement from the raw sign of `pct`
alone.

| Direction | Meaning | Regression When |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| `Lower` | Lower values are better | `current > baseline` (positive pct) |
| `Higher` | Higher values are better | `current < baseline` (negative pct) |

**Default Directions:**
- `wall_ms`: Lower (faster is better)
- `max_rss_kb`: Lower (less memory is better)
- `throughput_per_s`: Higher (more work per second is better)

Movement semantics are direction-aware:

| Metric shape | Improved | Regressed |
|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Lower is better, such as `wall_ms` | `pct < 0` | `pct > 0` |
| Higher is better, such as `throughput_per_s` | `pct > 0` | `pct < 0` |

The raw `pct` field is a signed measurement change:

```text
+10% throughput is an improvement.
+10% latency is a regression.
-10% throughput is a regression.
-10% latency is an improvement.
```

User-facing judgment should use movement/regression semantics, not sign-only
language. Raw signed percentages are still useful for display when the output
also carries metric direction, status, or normalized regression.

### Regression Calculation

The `regression` value is the normalized positive regression amount:

```rust
let regression = match direction {
    Direction::Lower => pct.max(0.0),     // Positive when current > baseline
    Direction::Higher => (-pct).max(0.0), // Positive when current < baseline
};
```

**Invariant:** `regression >= 0.0` always.

## Budget Thresholds

### Threshold Configuration

Each budget has two thresholds:

- `threshold`: The fail threshold (e.g., 0.20 for 20%)
- `warn_threshold`: The warn threshold (e.g., 0.18 for 18%)

**Relationship:**
```rust
warn_threshold = threshold * warn_factor
```

Where `warn_factor` defaults to 0.90.

### Status Determination

Metric status is determined by comparing regression to thresholds:

```rust
let status = if regression > threshold {
    MetricStatus::Fail
} else if regression >= warn_threshold {
    MetricStatus::Warn
} else {
    MetricStatus::Pass
};
```

**Boundary Conditions:**
- `regression > threshold` -> Fail
- `warn_threshold <= regression <= threshold` -> Warn
- `regression < warn_threshold` -> Pass

### Verdict Aggregation

The overall verdict is determined by the worst metric status:

```rust
let status = if counts.fail > 0 {
    VerdictStatus::Fail
} else if counts.warn > 0 {
    VerdictStatus::Warn
} else {
    VerdictStatus::Pass
};
```

### Verdict Reasons (Stable Tokens)

`verdict.reasons` stores stable tokens for downstream tooling. Tokens are not prose.

Format:
```
<metric>_<warn|fail>
```

Examples:
- `wall_ms_warn`
- `max_rss_kb_fail`
- `throughput_per_s_warn`

When no baseline is available, `check` uses the token `no_baseline`.

## Delta Structure

Each compared metric produces a Delta record:

```rust
pub struct Delta {
    pub baseline: f64,    // Baseline median value
    pub current: f64,     // Current median value
    pub ratio: f64,       // current / baseline
    pub pct: f64,         // Signed change: (current - baseline) / baseline
    pub regression: f64,  // Positive regression amount (0 if improvement)
    pub status: MetricStatus,  // Pass, Warn, or Fail
}
```

`pct` and `regression` intentionally answer different questions. `pct` says how
the number moved. `regression` says how much worse it got after applying metric
direction. Downstream receipts, reports, decision suggestions, tradeoff policy,
repair context, Action summaries, and decision bundles should use
`regression`, `MetricStatus`, or the shared movement helpers when deciding
whether a change is better or worse.

## Report Synthesis

### Finding Generation

The report command generates findings for metrics with Warn or Fail status:

1. Iterate over deltas in `BTreeMap` order (sorted by metric enum)
2. For each delta with status != Pass, create a `ReportFinding`
3. Set finding code: "metric_warn" or "metric_fail"
4. Set check_id: always "perf.budget"
5. Populate `FindingData` with metric details

**Invariants:**
- Finding count MUST equal warn count + fail count
- Findings MUST be ordered deterministically by metric name
- Report verdict MUST match compare verdict

### Stable Ordering

perfgate uses `BTreeMap` for all metric collections to ensure deterministic ordering:

- `Metric` enum implements `Ord` with ordering: `WallMs < MaxRssKb < ThroughputPerS`
- This ordering is preserved in JSON serialization (snake_case: `max_rss_kb < throughput_per_s < wall_ms`)
- Export commands sort metrics alphabetically for user-friendliness

### Finding Fingerprinting

Each sensor report finding includes a `fingerprint` containing the SHA-256 hex digest of a deterministic preimage. This ensures collision-resistant deduplication across sensors in the fleet.

**Preimage format:**

| Finding type | Preimage | Example preimage |
|-------------|----------|-----------------|
| Metric budget | `{check_id}:{code}:{metric_name}` | `perf.budget:metric_fail:wall_ms` |
| Runtime error | `{check_id}:{code}:{stage}` | `tool.runtime:runtime_error:config_parse` |
| Truncation | `{check_id}:{code}` | `tool.truncation:truncated` |
| Multi-bench metric | `{bench_name}:{check_id}:{code}:{metric_name}` | `bench-a:perf.budget:metric_fail:wall_ms` |

The `fingerprint` field stores `sha256(preimage)` as a 64-character lowercase hex string.

**Invariants:**
- Fingerprint MUST be present on all findings
- Same logical finding across runs MUST produce the same fingerprint
- Different findings MUST produce different fingerprints

### Finding Truncation

When a sensor report contains many findings (e.g., multi-bench mode with widespread regressions), findings can be truncated to a configurable limit via `SensorReportBuilder::max_findings(n)`.

**Behavior:**
1. If finding count <= limit, no truncation occurs
2. If finding count > limit, keep the first `limit - 1` findings
3. Append a truncation meta-finding with:
   - `check_id = "tool.truncation"`
   - `code = "truncated"`
   - `severity = "info"`
   - `data = { total_findings, shown_findings }`
   - `fingerprint = sha256("tool.truncation:truncated")`
4. `verdict.reasons` MUST include `"truncated"`
5. Report-level `data` MUST include `findings_total` and `findings_emitted`

**Canonical definitions of truncation counters:**
- `findings_total`: count of real findings before truncation (excludes the truncation meta-finding itself)
- `findings_emitted`: count of real findings preserved after truncation (excludes the truncation meta-finding itself)
- Invariant when truncated: `findings.len() == findings_emitted + 1` (the +1 is the truncation meta-finding)
- When NOT truncated: both `findings_total` and `findings_emitted` are absent from `data`

`contracts/fixtures/` are portable ingestion fixtures for cockpit compiler integration tests; `tests/fixtures/golden/` are perfgate CLI golden tests.

## Promote Normalization

The promote command can normalize receipts for stable baselines:

### Without Normalization

The receipt is copied unchanged. This preserves:
- Original `run.id` (UUID)
- Original timestamps
- All other fields

### With Normalization (`--normalize`)

Run-specific fields are replaced with stable values:

| Field | Original | Normalized |
|-------|----------|------------|
| `run.id` | UUID | "baseline" |
| `run.started_at` | RFC 3339 timestamp | "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z" |
| `run.ended_at` | RFC 3339 timestamp | "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z" |

**Preserved Fields:**
- `run.host` (all fields including cpu_count, memory_bytes, hostname_hash)
- `bench` (all metadata)
- `samples` (all sample data)
- `stats` (all computed statistics)
- `schema`, `tool`

## Export Formats

### CSV Format

RFC 4180 compliant CSV with the following characteristics:

- Header row MUST be present
- Fields containing comma, double quote, or newline MUST be quoted
- Double quotes within quoted fields MUST be escaped as `""`
- Rows end with `\n`

**Run Export Column Order:**
1. bench_name
2. wall_ms_median
3. wall_ms_min
4. wall_ms_max
5. max_rss_kb_median (empty if None)
6. throughput_median (empty if None, 6 decimal places if present)
7. sample_count
8. timestamp

**Compare Export Column Order:**
1. bench_name
2. metric
3. baseline_value (6 decimal places)
4. current_value (6 decimal places)
5. regression_pct (6 decimal places, percentage e.g., 10.5 for 10.5%)
6. status (lowercase: pass/warn/fail)
7. threshold (6 decimal places, percentage)

### JSONL Format

JSON Lines format with one JSON object per line:

- Each line MUST be a complete, valid JSON object
- Lines end with `\n`
- No trailing comma after the last field
- Field order matches CSV column order

## Overflow-Safe Median

The median algorithm for `u64` values uses an overflow-safe formula:

```rust
// For even-length sorted arrays with middle elements a and b:
let median = (a / 2) + (b / 2) + ((a % 2 + b % 2) / 2);
```

This avoids overflow when `a + b > u64::MAX` by:
1. Computing half of each value first
2. Adding the remainder halves separately
3. Rounding down (floor division)

**Verification:**
Property tests verify correctness against a reference implementation using `u128`.

## Metric Value Extraction

Statistics use median values for comparison:

```rust
fn metric_value(stats: &Stats, metric: Metric) -> Option<f64> {
    match metric {
        Metric::WallMs => Some(stats.wall_ms.median as f64),
        Metric::MaxRssKb => stats.max_rss_kb.as_ref().map(|s| s.median as f64),
        Metric::ThroughputPerS => stats.throughput_per_s.as_ref().map(|s| s.median),
    }
}
```

**Invariants:**
- `wall_ms` is always present (never None)
- `max_rss_kb` MAY be None (platform limits or collection failure)
- `throughput_per_s` MAY be None (no `work_units` specified)
- Metrics missing from either baseline or current are skipped in comparison

## Paired Benchmarking

Paired mode interleaves baseline and current executions to reduce environmental noise:

```
baseline-1, current-1, baseline-2, current-2, ...
```

### Execution Model

1. For each pair `i` in `0..samples`:
   - Execute baseline command, record `wall_ms`
   - Execute current command, record `wall_ms`
2. Compute statistics from all baseline samples and all current samples independently
3. Compare using the same budget/threshold logic as `compare`

### Advantages

- Back-to-back measurement minimizes environmental variance between baseline and current
- Interleaving prevents systematic bias from thermal throttling or load changes
- Uses standard `perfgate.compare.v1` output, compatible with all downstream tools

## Host Mismatch Detection

When comparing runs, perfgate can detect and warn about host differences.

### Detection Criteria

A mismatch is detected when any of the following differ between baseline and current:
- `os` string
- `arch` string
- `cpu_count` value
- `hostname_hash` value (if both present)

### Policy Behavior

| Policy | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| `warn` | Emit warning to stderr, continue comparison (default) |
| `error` | Exit 1 with error message |
| `ignore` | No check performed |
